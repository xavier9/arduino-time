The Time library adds timekeeping functionality to Arduino with or without external timekeeping hardware.

It allows a sketch to get the time and date as:
> second, minute, hour, day, month and year.

It also provides time as a standard C time\_t so elapsed times can be easily calculated and time values shared across different platforms.

Example sketches are available illustrating use with:
> A Real Time Clock
> Internet NTP time service
> GPS time data
> Serial time messages from a computer
